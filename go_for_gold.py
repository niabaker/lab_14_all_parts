What number should I translate into a medal?
>1
gold

What number should I translate into a medal?
>3
bronze

What number should I translate into a medal?
>23
no medal for you!

"""

if int(medal) <1 or int(medal) > 3:
	print ('not valid placement')

if int(medal) == 1:
	print('gold')
elif int(medal) == 3:
	print ('bronze')
elif int(medal) == 2:
	print ('silver')
else:
	print ('no medal for you!')
